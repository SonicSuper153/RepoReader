Of course\! I've refined your `README.md` to improve its structure, clarity, and formatting. The core information remains the same, but the presentation is now more professional and user-friendly.

Here is the revised version:

# ü§ñ RepoReader: AI-Powered README Generator

**RepoReader** is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates a high-quality `README.md` for any GitHub repository. By analyzing the codebase, extracting key components, and summarizing functionality, it produces clear and structured documentation that can save developers hours of manual writing.

It leverages **LangChain** for code summarization and **Google Generative AI** for text generation, offering both standard README generation and advanced example-driven generation using vector stores.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The tool is built with a modular architecture:

1.  **Helper:** Clones the target repository and extracts all relevant code files.
2.  **Generators:** Summarizes the extracted code and generates the final README content.
3.  **Brain:** Interfaces with Google Generative AI models for both the core LLM functionalities and text embeddings.
4.  **FastAPI App:** Exposes REST API endpoints and serves the web interface for generating README files.
